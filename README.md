# Yet-Another-Social-Media-Platform

**Introduction:**

Yet Another Social Media Platform (YASMP) is a simple user-friendly platform that lets users establish their profile and publish their content in many genres, allowing them to interact with a group of like-minded individuals and comment on their posts. It would also allow users to share other posts that they enjoy with their connections. Furthermore, the app will allow users to raise awareness of social concerns that are occurring throughout the world by posting the content. Users may upload multimedia (pictures and videos), publish them on their profiles, and like and comment on posts made by their connections. Along with these functionalities, users may interact with each other, respond to one another's messages, and save content by creating a collection list.
